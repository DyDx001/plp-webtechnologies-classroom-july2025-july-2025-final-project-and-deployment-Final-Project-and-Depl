## Project Purpose & Overview

- Serving as a demonstration of my web development capabilities (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, deployment).

## Sections

Although implemented as a single-page site, the layout is modular and mirrors a multi-page structure:

1. Home 
2. About  
3. Education  
4. Skills  
5. Projects  
6. Contact  

Navigation flows smoothly with internal anchor links, and every section is designed to represent a full pageâ€™s worth of content.
